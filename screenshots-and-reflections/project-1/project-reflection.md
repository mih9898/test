# Project Reflection

#### What were your AHA!! moments while completing this project?
I did read poorly the objective of the project as a result I spent 
some time trying to prove Test-Validotor that I am right.
Then I reread the objectives and there was "AHA"

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 
I used my notes and oracle documentation.
Some clarification, I have around 2000 lines of java notes that
I did before
