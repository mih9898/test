# Project Reflection

Project went well 

#### What were your AHA!! moments while completing this project?

There was constructor Search(type,term) and somewhere I passed    
arguments vice versa; as result, I did spent quiet time to debug it.  
  
Plus, tomcat logs sometimes were not enough to debug

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 
* my notes  
* java oracle documentation
