#### What went well this week? 

reading/understanding material provided in videos/notes
#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I got stuck on the lab2. Firstly, I did it that the run method could accept from 0 to many parameters including command line one(with "..." and overloading).
However, it should be hardcoded in the main.
#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

No additional resources were used.
