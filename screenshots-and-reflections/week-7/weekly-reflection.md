#### What went well this week? 

lab3-7 
#### What didn't go so well this week? 

I had issues with lab3(properties) because I did it without lectures/videos.
For some reasons lecture/videos about properties ae attached as for next week only  

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

my notes
stackoverflow(it wasn't obvious to me that should be /file.properties and not just file.properties)
